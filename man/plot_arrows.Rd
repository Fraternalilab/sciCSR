\usage{
plot_arrows(
  anndata_file,
  img_path,
  type = "velocity",
  style = "grid",
  colour.by = "seurat_clusters",
  cols = NULL,
  components = "1,2",
  conda_env = "scicsr"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{anndata_file}{input anndata_file. If `type` is 'velocity', this file needs to be output from `run_scVelo`. If `type` is 'CSR' or 'SHM', the columns 'csr_pot' or 'shm' should be in the .obs slot of the AnnData object.}

\item{img_path}{path to write out output PNG/SVG/PDF file containing the arrow plot. The exact output format is selected according to the file extension. A PNG of 600 dots per inch will be rendered.}

\item{type}{one of 'velocity', 'CSR', 'SHM'. The type of information to be used to project arrows. Each has requirements on the input `anndata_file` (see above).}

\item{style}{one of 'grid' (lay out arrows on a grid of fixed width/height on the UMAP plot) or 'stream' (draw arrows as streams), in the style of the scvelo 'pl.velocity_embedding_grid' or 'pl.velocity_embedding_stream' respectively.}

\item{colour.by}{column in gene expression metadata to group and colour the cells by (Default: 'seurat_clusters')}

\item{cols}{Optional, a vector of characters containing the HEX code of colours to be used. Has to be the same length as the number of levels found in the `colour.by` variable in the gene expression metadata.}

\item{components}{component of dimensionality reduction to show in the plot. e.g. put \'1,3\' if desired UMAP plot displays the UMAP_1 and UMAP_3 axes.(Default: '1,2')}

\item{conda_env}{character, if not NULL this named conda environment is used to perform the merge.
(Default: 'scicsr'). If NULL, no conda environment will be used, the program assumes the python packages `scanpy` and `scvelo` are installed in the local python)}

\description{
`plot_arrows` plots arrows on top of UMAP projection to show transitions in the style of conventional RNA velocity analysis. You can indicate whether to use RNA velocity (`type = 'velocity'`), CSR (`type = 'CSR'`) or SHM (`type = 'SHM'`) information to project the arrows.
}
\details{
`plot_arrows` uses the plotting functionalities in scVelo in python to generate a plot of arrows indicating transitions, given the type of biological information (velocity/CSR/SHM). You can choose between projecting transitions as arrows laid out on a grid (`style = 'grid'`) or as streams of arrows (`style = 'stream'`). The plot is saved as a SVG/PDF/PNG (depending on file extension given in `img_path`, see below), and re-rendered in the 'plot' panel in R.
