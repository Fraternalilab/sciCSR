\title{wrapper function to scan sterile/productive IGH molecules from BAM file}
\usage{
getIGHmapping(
  bam,
  definitions,
  cellBarcodeTag = "CB",
  umiTag = "UB",
  paired = FALSE,
  flank = 5000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bam}{filepath to the BAM file to read}

\item{definitions}{A list of \code{GenomicRanges::GRanges} object, each specifying the genomic coordinates of VDJ genes, C genes coding segments and sterile C transcripts. See the data objects 'human_definitions' and 'mouse_definitions' in the sciCSR package for formats.}

\item{cellBarcodeTag}{Name of tag holding information about cell barcode. The code expects and extracts this tag from each line in the BAM alignments. Set as NULL or NA if no such information is available in the BAM file. (Default: "CB")}

\item{umiTag}{Name of tag holding information about molecule barcode. The code expects and extracts this tag from each line in the BAM alignments. Set as NULL or NA if no such information is available in the BAM file. (Default: "UB")}

\item{paired}{Are the sequencing reads paired-end? (Default: FALSE)}

\item{flank}{either (1) an integer (indicating 5' distance from the CH exons) or (2) a \code{GRanges} object (indicating exact genomic positions) for defining sterile IgH transcripts. Ignored if the positions of sterile transcripts are already included in \code{definitions}.}
}
\value{
A list with two items:
\describe{
  \item{read_count}{a data.frame in wide format indicating for each cell barcodes and UMI combination, the number of **reads** (Note: NOT UMI!) covering VDJ, and the Coding region (C) or 5' intronic region (I) of each IGH C gene.}
  \item{junction_reads}{a data.frame of spliced reads and their mapped cell barcodes & UMIs. Either genuine spliced productive IgH transcripts, or strange molecules potentially worth detailed inspection. NULL if \code{getJunctionReads} return with an error.}
}
}
\description{
\code{getIGHmapping} is the wrapper function intended for users to supply a BAM file,
and scan for sterile and productive IGH transcripts over each C gene as defined in the parameter
\code{IGHC_granges}.
}
\details{
The function reads in two \code{GenomicRanges::GRanges} objects, one defining the genomic
coordinates of the IGHC genes and another for the VDJ genes. It scans the BAM file
for reads covering these regions, extracting their mapped cell barcodes and Unique
Molecule identifier (UMI). Sterile reads are defined as those covering the intronic region
upstream of the 5' end of the C gene coding region - the default is to consider the region
(min(\code{previous_C_CDS_end}, \code{-flank}), 0), where \code{previous_C_CDS_end} refers to the
3' end of the coding region of the previous C gene, and \code{flank} is an integr, given by the
user, which indicates 'how far' the function should looks 5' of the coding region for
sterile reads.
If you have information on where the sterile transcripts begin, these coordinatees can be
passed as a \code{GRanges} object to the parameter \code{flank} (see examples).
Outputs data frame of cell barcodes and molecules mapped to
each IGHC gene, classified as sterile/productive/C-only.
